# COP3223-Project1

## At Valence community college, a student must take exactly two courses  (We’ll drop this constraint when we cover control structures). The purpose of this assignment is to construct a fee invoice for a student. This requires the input of Student’s id as an integer, the two course numbers as integers and the credit hours for each course.  It costs 120.25 dollars per credit hour in addition to $35.00 charged for health and id services.
